# Dataset Info
The following details are included in the dataset that was used:

1. Customer account information includes the number of months the customer has been with the company, paperless billing, payment method, monthly charges, and total charges. 
2. Demographic information about customers includes gender, age, and marital status.
3. Consumer behavior when it comes to streaming movies and TV shows, Phone service, multiples, internet service, online security, online backup, device protection, and tech support were among the services the customer signed up for.
4. Customer churn refers to those who have left within the previous month.

# Why is it Required

The telecom company needs to do a churn analysis to find out why the customer stopped using its service or product. It is difficult for the telecom company to improve its product and service until it knows how much revenue is lost overall as a result of customer cancellations, which customers are canceling, and why they are canceling.

As a common classification issue in the field of supervised learning, churn rate analysis is why I have employed **Random Forest Regression** to examine customer churn patterns.
